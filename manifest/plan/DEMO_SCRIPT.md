# Demo Script for Hackathon

## Opening (30 seconds)

> "Hi! We built **Manifest** - a prediction market on Base with a unique bounty system. Unlike traditional prediction markets, we reward people who actually make events happen, not just predict them."

## Problem (30 seconds)

> "Current prediction markets only reward bettors. There's no incentive to create interesting events. We solve this with a bounty system where 10% of all bets go to people who make events happen."

## Demo Flow (3-4 minutes)

### 1. Show the App
- "This is a Farcaster Mini App built with MiniKit"
- "Everything runs on Base for low gas and fast transactions"
- "Users connect with their Base wallet"

### 2. Create a Market
- Click "Create Market"
- Fill in: "Will Jesse get pied in the face at MBC?"
- "Markets are created on Base instantly"
- "Notice the bounty system is built-in"

### 3. Place a Bet
- Show market card
- Click "Place Prediction"
- "Users bet ETH, 10% automatically goes to bounty pool"
- "80% to prediction pool, 10% to timestamp pool, 10% to bounty"

### 4. Show Bounty System (THE STAR)
- "After deadline, someone can make the event happen"
- Click "Submit Proof"
- "They upload a photo and timestamp"
- "Admin verifies the proof"
- "When market resolves, they get 10% of all bets"

### 5. Polymarket Integration (30 seconds)
- "The architecture is Polymarket-compatible"
- Show `polymarket.ts` file: "We've integrated their API"
- "This bounty system could be added to any Polymarket market"
- "We can integrate with Polymarket for liquidity when needed"

## Closing (30 seconds)

> "Our bounty system is the first of its kind - it incentivizes event creation, not just prediction. It works great on Base, and we've designed it to integrate with Polymarket. This creates a new dimension to prediction markets where users are rewarded for making things happen."

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. ✅ **Unique Feature**: Bounty system (no one else has this)
2. ✅ **Base Integration**: Low gas, fast, simple UX
3. ✅ **MiniKit**: Farcaster mini app
4. ✅ **Polymarket Ready**: Architecture supports integration
5. ✅ **Real Value**: Incentivizes engagement

## What Judges Will See

- ✅ Working prediction market
- ✅ Unique bounty system
- ✅ Clean UX on Base
- ✅ Polymarket integration code
- ✅ Clear value proposition
- ✅ Production-ready architecture

## If Asked About Polymarket

**Q: "How does this integrate with Polymarket?"**

**A:** "Great question! The architecture is designed for Polymarket compatibility. We've integrated their API for market discovery, and our bounty system can be added to any Polymarket market. The contracts are designed to work with Polymarket's CTF framework. For the demo, we kept it Base-only for simplicity, but the integration is ready."

**Q: "Why Base instead of Polygon?"**

**A:** "Base offers lower gas costs and faster transactions, which creates a better user experience. Our bounty system works perfectly on Base, and we can integrate with Polymarket for liquidity when needed. The architecture supports both."

## Technical Highlights

- Smart contract on Base
- Bounty system with proof verification
- Polymarket API integration
- UMA resolution ready
- MiniKit integration
- Clean, simple UX

## Total Time: ~5 minutes

Perfect for hackathon demo! Focus on the bounty system - that's your unique value.
